# 💬 LLMind

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)

**LLMind** is a personalized AI chatbot built from scratch using **transfer learning**, **LLMs**, and modern **full-stack technologies**.  
Unlike typical bots that rely on external APIs, LLMind features a **self-trained** lightweight language model fine-tuned for conversational behavior and served through a custom backend.

> 🚀 This project is part of a long-term AI roadmap focused on learning, building, and deploying intelligent assistants.
