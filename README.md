# 💬 LLMind

**LLMind** is a personal AI chatbot project built from scratch using **transfer learning**, **LLMs**, and full-stack web technologies. Instead of relying on external APIs, LLMind features a self-trained lightweight language model fine-tuned for chatbot behavior and served on a custom backend.

This project aims to teach and demonstrate:
- 🤖 LLM and NLP foundations using Hugging Face Transformers  
- 🧠 Transfer learning and chatbot fine-tuning  
- 🌐 Full-stack integration (HTML, CSS, JS + Django backend)  
- 🚀 Model serving, API development, and deployment
